# üì∏ Photo Upload Fix - Quick Guide

## ‚ùå Problem
You're getting **"Failed to upload photos"** error when trying to upload photos to albums.

## ‚úÖ Solution - Follow These Steps

### Step 1: Get Your Supabase Credentials

1. Go to https://app.supabase.com
2. Select your project (or create one if you don't have it)
3. Click **Settings** (gear icon in sidebar) ‚Üí **API**
4. You'll see two important values:
   - **Project URL** (looks like: `https://xxxxx.supabase.co`)
   - **anon public key** (long string starting with `eyJ...`)

**Copy both of these!** üìã

---

### Step 2: Create the Storage Bucket

1. In Supabase Dashboard, click **Storage** in the left sidebar
2. Click **"New bucket"** button
3. Fill in:
   - **Name:** `albums` (exactly this, lowercase)
   - **Public bucket:** ‚úÖ **CHECK THIS BOX** (very important!)
   - Click **Create bucket**

---

### Step 3: Set Up Bucket Policies

1. Click on your new `albums` bucket
2. Click the **"Policies"** tab
3. Click **"New Policy"** ‚Üí **"For full customization"**
4. Use this quick policy (copy-paste):

**Policy Name:** `Allow All Operations`

**Policy Definition:**
```sql
-- Allow public read access
CREATE POLICY "Public can read albums"
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
TO public
USING ( bucket_id = 'albums' );

-- Allow authenticated users to upload
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated can upload"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK ( bucket_id = 'albums' );

-- Allow authenticated users to update
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated can update"
ON storage.objects FOR UPDATE
TO authenticated
USING ( bucket_id = 'albums' );

-- Allow authenticated users to delete
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated can delete"
ON storage.objects FOR DELETE
TO authenticated
USING ( bucket_id = 'albums' );
```

Click **"Review"** ‚Üí **"Save policy"**

### Step 4: Create `.env` File

1. In your project root folder, create a file named **`.env`** (exactly this name)
2. Add these lines (replace with YOUR values from Step 1):

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://xxxxx.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
```

**Important:** 
- Replace `xxxxx.supabase.co` with YOUR Project URL
- Replace the key with YOUR anon public key
- Don't use the `service_role` key!

---

### Step 5: Restart Your Dev Server

Stop your dev server (Ctrl+C) and start again:

```bash
npm run dev
```

---

### Step 6: Test It!

1. Open http://localhost:5173
2. Login with your account
3. Go to **Photo Album** section
4. Click **"Create New Album"**
5. Fill in title and click **"Create Album"**
6. Select the album from the list
7. Click **"Choose File"** and select a photo
8. Click **Upload**

‚úÖ **It should work now!**

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Still getting errors?

**Check the browser console (F12 ‚Üí Console tab):**

#### If you see: "Supabase configuration missing"
- Your `.env` file is not found or has wrong variable names
- Make sure file is named exactly `.env` (not `.env.txt`)
- Variables must start with `VITE_`
- Restart dev server after creating `.env`

#### If you see: "Bucket not found"
- Bucket name must be exactly `albums` (lowercase)
- Check it exists in Supabase Storage

#### If you see: "Permission denied" or "new row violates row-level security"
- Bucket must be marked as **Public**
- Storage policies must be set up
- You must be logged in with Firebase

#### If you see: "Failed to save photo metadata"
- Backend must be running on port 8000
- Run: `cd backend-python && python main.py`
- Check backend logs for errors

## üìÅ What Your `.env` File Should Look Like

```env
# Copy this template and fill in YOUR values

# From Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí API
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://abcdefghijklmnop.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6ImFiY2RlZmdoaWprbG1ub3AiLCJyb2xlIjoiYW5vbiIsImlhdCI6MTYxNjQzODUwMCwiZXhwIjoxOTMxOTk4NTAwfQ.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

# If you're also using Firebase (optional)
# VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-key
# VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-domain
# VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
```

## üÜò Still Not Working?

1. **Check browser console (F12)** for exact error message

5. **Make sure you're logged in** with Firebase Auth

If you see a specific error message, search for it in `SUPABASE_STORAGE_SETUP.md` for detailed troubleshooting.

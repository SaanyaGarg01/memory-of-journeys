# Database Setup Instructions

Your Supabase connection is working! ✅ But the tables need to be created.

## Option 1: Using Supabase Dashboard (Recommended)

1. **Go to Supabase SQL Editor**:
   - Visit: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/hgbejfekzsvxsqxmrtgg/sql/new
   - Or: Dashboard → Your Project → SQL Editor

2. **Run the migration**:
   - Copy the entire contents of `supabase/migrations/20251016083714_create_journey_platform_schema.sql`
   - Paste into the SQL Editor
   - Click "Run" or press Ctrl+Enter

3. **Verify tables were created**:
   - Go to Table Editor
   - You should see: `airports`, `airlines`, `routes`, `journeys`, `journey_legs`, etc.

## Option 2: Using the Migration Runner Script

I can create a Node.js script that will run the migration automatically using the Supabase client.

## What happens after migration?

Once the tables are created, your app will:
- ✅ Show green "Connected" status in the header
- ✅ Allow creating new journeys
- ✅ Store all journey data in Supabase
- ✅ Enable all AI features with real data

## Current Status

- **Supabase URL**: https://hgbejfekzsvxsqxmrtgg.supabase.co
- **Connection**: ✅ Working
- **Tables**: ❌ Need to be created
- **Error**: "Could not find the table 'public.journeys' in the schema cache"

Would you like me to:
1. Create an automated migration runner script?
2. Help you run it manually in the Supabase dashboard?

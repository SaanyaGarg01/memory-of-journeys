## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT" in console
**Solution:** This is caused by browser ad blockers blocking Lucide icon requests. It's harmless and doesn't affect functionality. You can safely ignore it or whitelist localhost in your ad blocker.

### Issue: Voice recording doesn't work
**Solution:** 
1. Grant microphone permissions when prompted
2. Ensure you're on HTTPS or localhost
3. Check browser compatibility (works best in Chrome/Edge)

### Issue: Gallery images not loading
**Solution:** Check internet connection - gallery uses Picsum API for placeholder images.

### Issue: No journeys showing in features
**Solution:** Create at least one journey in the "Create" tab first. All bonus features require journey data to function.

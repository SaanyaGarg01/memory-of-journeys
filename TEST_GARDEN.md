# 🌸 Test Memory Garden - Quick Guide

## ✅ Backend is Running!

Your Python backend started successfully. Those warnings about tables existing are **normal** - it means the tables are already created.

---

## 🚀 Complete Test Instructions:

### **Step 1: Make Sure Backend is Still Running**

The backend should be running. If it stopped, restart it:
```bash
cd backend-python
python main.py
```

**Keep this terminal open!** You should see:
```
INFO: Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000
```

---

### **Step 2: Start Frontend**

Open a **NEW terminal** and run:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Opens at: `http://localhost:5174`

---

### **Step 3: Create a Journey**

1. **Log in** to the application
2. **Go to Create** (click "Create" button in nav)
3. **Fill in journey details:**
   ```
   Title: Beach Trip to Goa
   Description: Amazing beach vacation
   Keywords: beach, ocean, sunset, paradise
   Journey Type: solo
   
   Leg 1:
   From City: Mumbai
   To City: Goa
   To Country: India
   Transport: flight
   ```
4. **Click "Generate Journey"**

---

### **Step 4: Check Backend Logs**

In the Python terminal, you should see:
```
🌸 Planted rose for journey 'Beach Trip to Goa' at position (250, 350)
```

**If you see this** → Flower was planted successfully! ✅

**If you DON'T see this:**
- User might not be logged in (anonymous users don't get flowers)
- Check if journey was created successfully
- Look for error messages in terminal

---

### **Step 5: View Your Garden**

1. **Go to AI Features** (click "AI Features" in nav)
2. **Scroll down** to Bonus Features section
3. **Click "Virtual Memory Garden"** 🌸

**You should see:**
- Stats showing: 1 Total Plant, 0 Fully Grown, 1 Growing
- A flower emoji on the garden canvas
- Click the flower to see details

---

### **Step 6: Water Your Flower**

1. **Click on the flower** in the garden
2. Details panel opens on the right
3. **Click "Water Plant"** button
4. Growth stage increases: 1 → 2
5. Flower emoji changes
6. Water again to grow more: 2 → 3 → 4 → 5
7. At stage 5, you see sparkles! ✨

---

## 🔍 Troubleshooting:

### **Problem: No flower appears in garden**

**Check 1: Is user logged in?**
- Click on your profile picture in top-right
- If you see your name, you're logged in ✅
- If not, log in with Google

**Check 2: Did journey save?**
- Go to "Explore" tab
- Your journey should be listed there
- If not, journey didn't save

**Check 3: Check database directly**
```sql
-- Connect to database
mysql -u root -p travel_memory

-- Check if flower was planted
SELECT * FROM memory_garden_plants;
```

Should show your plant with journey_id.

**Check 4: Backend logs**
- Look at Python terminal
- Should see: `🌸 Planted ...`
- If not, flower wasn't planted

---

### **Problem: Backend keeps reloading**

This is **normal** with `reload=True`. The backend is working fine.

The reloads happen when files change. As long as you see:
```
INFO: Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000
```

It's running correctly.

---

### **Problem: "User might be anonymous"**

Anonymous users (not logged in) don't get flowers.

**Solution:**
1. Click "Login" button
2. Log in with Google
3. Create journey again
4. Should work now

---

## 🧪 Quick Verification Commands:

### **Test Backend Health:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/health
```

Should return:
```json
{"ok":true,"time":"2024-10-24T..."}
```

### **Test Garden Endpoint:**
```bash
# Replace YOUR_USER_ID with your Firebase user ID
curl http://localhost:8000/api/garden/YOUR_USER_ID
```

Should return array of plants (or empty array if no plants).

### **Check Database:**
```sql
-- Show all plants
SELECT plant_name, plant_type, growth_stage, user_id FROM memory_garden_plants;

-- Count plants per user
SELECT user_id, COUNT(*) as plant_count FROM memory_garden_plants GROUP BY user_id;
```

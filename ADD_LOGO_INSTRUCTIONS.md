# 🎨 How to Add Your Logo

## ✅ Code Changes Complete!

I've already updated your code to display the logo in:
- ✅ Navbar (top-left corner)
- ✅ Hero section (large logo on homepage)
- ✅ Browser tab favicon

---

## 📁 Now Add the Logo File

### Step 1: Save Your Logo Image

1. **Right-click** on the logo image I showed you
2. **Save as** → `logo.png`
3. Save it to your desktop temporarily

---

### Step 2: Create Public Folder

**Option A - Using File Explorer:**
1. Open your project folder: `c:\Users\LENOVO\mariaDB\website\memory-of-journeys`
2. Create a new folder named exactly: `public`
3. Copy `logo.png` into the `public` folder

**Option B - Using Terminal:**
```bash
cd c:\Users\LENOVO\mariaDB\website\memory-of-journeys
mkdir public
# Then copy your logo.png file into the public folder
```

---

### Step 3: Verify File Location

Your logo should be at:
```
c:\Users\LENOVO\mariaDB\website\memory-of-journeys\public\logo.png
```

**File structure should look like:**
```
memory-of-journeys/
├── public/
│   └── logo.png          ← Your logo here!
├── src/
├── backend-python/
├── package.json
└── ...
```

---

### Step 4: Restart Dev Server

1. **Stop** your current dev server (Ctrl+C)
2. **Start** it again:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## ✨ What You'll See

### Navbar (Top-Left)
- Small logo (48px × 48px)
- Next to "Memory of Journeys" text
- Clickable - returns to home

### Hero Section (Homepage)
- Large logo (160px × 160px on desktop, 128px on mobile)
- Centered at the top
- Beautiful drop shadow effect

### Browser Tab
- Logo as favicon
- Shows in browser tab and bookmarks

---

## 🔄 Alternative: Use Transparent Background Version

If you have a version of the logo with transparent background (PNG):
1. Name it `logo.png`
2. It will look better on dark/light themes
3. The navy blue background from your image can be removed in image editing software

## 🎨 Logo Specifications

**Current Implementation:**
- Format: PNG recommended (supports transparency)
- Size: Any size (auto-scaled)
- Aspect ratio: 1:1 (square) works best
- File name: Must be exactly `logo.png` (lowercase)

**Optimal Sizes:**
- Navbar: Displays at 48px × 48px
- Hero: Displays at 160px × 160px (desktop)
- Favicon: Browser uses various sizes

**Recommendation:**
- Provide at least 512px × 512px PNG for best quality
- Transparent background preferred

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Logo Not Showing?

**Check 1: File Location**
```bash
# Run this in terminal to verify file exists
dir public\logo.png
```

**Check 2: File Name**
- Must be exactly `logo.png` (lowercase)
- Not `Logo.png` or `logo.PNG`

**Check 3: Clear Browser Cache**
- Press Ctrl+Shift+R to hard refresh
- Or Ctrl+F5

**Check 4: Check Browser Console**
- Press F12 → Console tab
- Look for 404 errors about logo.png
- If you see errors, file is in wrong location

### Still See Compass Icon?

If you still see the compass icon in navbar:
- Logo file is missing or wrong location
- The code has a fallback to show compass icon
- Add the logo file to `public/logo.png`
